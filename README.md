**Abstract**  
Paleolithic lithic assemblages are usually dominated by flakes, which
display a high degree of morphological variability. When analyzing
Paleolithic lithic assemblages, it is common to classify flakes into
categories based on their morphological and technological features,
which are linked to the position of the flake in a reduction sequence
and how removals are organized in a given production method. For the
analysis of Middle Paleolithic lithic assemblages, two categories of
flakes are commonly used: core edge flakes and pseudo-Levallois points.
A third type, core edge flakes with a limited back, is also commonly
found in the archaeological literature, providing an alternative
category with a definition that does not match the two previous types
but shares many of their morphological and technological features. The
present study addresses whether these three flakes constitute discrete
categories based on their morphological and technological attributes.
Geometric morphometrics are employed on an experimental set composed of
the three categories of flakes to quantify morphological variation.
Machine learning models and principal components biplots are used to
test the discreteness of the categories. The results indicate that
geometric morphometrics succeed in capturing the morphological and
technological features that characterize each type of product.
Pseudo-Levallois points have the highest discreteness of the three
technological products, and while some degree of mixture exists between
core edge flakes and core edge flakes with a limited back, they are also
highly distinguishable. We conclude that the three categories are
discrete and can be employed in technological lists of products for the
analysis of lithic assemblages and that geometric morphometrics is
useful for testing for the validity of categories.
