            The systematic study of chipped stone debitage provides important information about prehistoric lithic technology. However, the results of most debitage analyses are unconvincing because of questionable assumptions and inherent flaws in the typologies used to classify the material. After briefly reviewing these problems, we present an alternative approach that does not rely on the presumed technological origins of individual artifacts as the basis for debitage classification and interpretation. An important element of this approach is a typology composed of interpretation-free and mutually exclusive debitage categories. The derivation of this typology is described and the utility of the approach is demonstrated with two Arizona case studies. The TEP St. Johns project provides new data and interpretations about Archaic Period technological and settlement changes while the Pitiful Flats study illustrates how differences in functional and organizational factors affect debitage assemblage variability.},

	abstract = {Genetic and climate-driven estimates of past population dynamics are increasingly inﬂuential in broader models of hominin migration and adaptation, yet the contribution of stone artifact variability remains more contentious. Scientists are increasingly recognizing the potential of unretouched stone ﬂakes (‘ﬂakes’) in exploring existing models of hominin behavioral evolution. This is because ﬂakes (1) were produced by all stone tool manufacturing groups in the past, (2) are abundant from the inception of the archaeological record up into the ethnographic present, and (3) preserve under most conditions. The statistical tools of 3D geometric morphometrics capture detailed approximations of ﬂake form that are challenging to document with conventional artifact analyses. We analyze a collection of 717 3D scans of experimentally produced ﬂakes from 5 production strategies that were practiced by hominins through large parts of the Pleistocene and that scientists have drawn on also to make demographic arguments about past human behavior (n ¼ 45 reduction sequences, n ¼ 3 knappers naive toward the study objectives). First, as a proof of concept, we demonstrate that we can estimate the strategies used to produce these ﬂakes at a high success rate even when ﬂakes from early stages of core reduction are included. We frame the signiﬁcance of this ﬁnding against archaeological classiﬁcations from several key Middle Paleolithic assemblages in France (n ¼ 4 sites, n ¼ 28 layers, n ¼ 16,467 ﬂakes). Second, we show that 3D geometric morphometrics captures subtle differences in these strategies that inﬂuence ﬂake formation on a ﬂake-by-ﬂake basis and that reﬂect decisions made by knappers about platform selection, preparation, and core-surface management. We explore the broader potential of our model with a crossvalidation approach, and we describe a means of assessing ﬂake form on a continuum wherein variability among assemblages separated by large expanses of space and time can be meaningfully explored. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Although medical image analysts typically prefer to represent scenes by way of curving outlines or surfaces, the most recent developments in this associated statistical methodology have emphasized the domain of landmark data: size and shape of conﬁgurations of discrete, named points in two or three dimensions. This paper introduces a combination of Procrustes analysis and thin-plate splines, the two most powerful tools of landmark-based morphometrics, for multivariate analysis of curving outlines in samples of biomedical images. The thin-plate spline is used to assign pointto-point correspondences, called semi-landmarks, between curves of similar but variable shape, while the standard algorithm for Procrustes shape averages and shape coordinates is altered to accord with the ways in which semi-landmarks formally differ from more traditional landmark loci. Subsequent multivariate statistics and visualization proceed mainly as in the landmark-based methods. The combination provides a range of complementary ﬁlters, from high pass to low pass, for effects on outline shape in grouped studies. The low-pass version is based on the spectrum of the spline, the high pass, on a familiar special case of Procrustes analysis. This hybrid method is demonstrated in a comparison of the shape of the corpus callosum from mid-sagittal sections of MRI of 25 human brains, 12 normal and 13 with schizophrenia.},

	abstract = {The research during the construction of the M-50 highway has allowed the study of the silica levels that constitute the most important Neolithic flint mine in the Iberian Peninsula. A group of more than 3.800 extraction pits were realized to obtain cherts and opals that appear among Mg smectites beds (Aragonian deposits). The description of the nodular and stratiform silica levels and the study of their types and distribution have been done at geological sections obtained during the archaeological excavations. Three petrological types of siliceous rocks (chert, opal and opaline chert) are established and defined according to their mineralogy and microfacies. Cherts are constituted only by quartz and locally minor amounts of moganite. Opals contain opal CT, Mg smectites and minor quartz. Opaline chert is defined when the proportion of quartz is higher than 50\%. All the types of siliceous rocks reproduce bioturbation structures as well as other structures found in the host rocks (grains, intraclasts, brecciation). The silica levels at the base of the columns are constituted only by chert and were formed by the silicification of nodular and lenticular dolomite levels included in the Mg-smectites beds. The rest of the siliceous levels are composed of opals and opaline cherts and were formed by silicification of Mg-smectites. The outer part of the opaline chert has a higher content in opal and clay relicts whereas the inner part is mainly microcrystalline quartz. This change is consequence of the recrystallization of the opal (aging) producing a more compact silica rock. The main silicification occurred under the groundwater table because the structure of the host rocks is conserved in the silica rocks. A general question is whether the silica that precipites is introduced by groundwater or it is released from the dissolution of clays during their replacement.},

	abstract = {The Miocene of the Madrid basin includes relatively abundant silica rocks (cherts, opals and opaline cherts), which were used during the Palaeolithic and Neolithic to make lithic tools. This work establishes the chemical characteristics that can be used to classify those silica rocks on the basis of their geographical location, explaining at the same time their mineralogical, petrological and geochemical features. The geographical classification of silica rocks is very useful to define the source areas of lithic tools made during the Prehistory. The mineralogical and petrological classification was made using transmitted light optical microscopy, X-Ray diffraction and Raman spectrometry. Chemical analyses of major, minor and rare elements were performed using Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) mass and emission spectrometry. Most of the silica rocks from the Miocene of the Madrid basin were formed by the replacement of sedimentary rocks that constitute the infill of the basin. This process implies the dissolution of the host rock (limestone, dolostone, gypsum, clays, etc.) and the precipitation of silica minerals (quartz, opaline phases and moganite). Both, the chemical composition of the host rock relicts and the elements incorporated by the opaline phases, constitutes a characteristic geochemical signature from each sampled zone (sample group). Therefore, this signature can be used to define and characterize silica rocks on the basis of their geographical location. The study of the data was carried out using bivariate analysis (i.e. correlation coefficients) and multivariate analysis (i.e. main components and the discriminant function). All the chemical elements analyzed are important in the discriminant analysis, because when fewer elements are taken into account (even when only those elements with a lower weight in the discriminant function are removed), the number of samples that can be included in the groups decreases importantly.},

Of special importance are the shape-measures induced on CPk{\textasciitilde}2 by any assigned diffuse law of distribution for the k vertices. We determine several such shape-measures, we resolve some of the technical problems associated with the graphic presentation and statistical analysis of empirical shape distributions, and among applications we discuss the relevance of these ideas to testing for the presence of non-accidental multiple alignments in collections of (i) neolithic stone monuments and (ii) quasars. Finally the recently introduced Ambartzumian density is examined from the present point of view, its norming constant is found, and its connexion with random Crofton polygons is established.},

For the Middle Paleolithic, the best documented are the Levallois debitage system, the laminar production system, the discoidal debitage system, and the Quina debitage system. Their geographical and chronological distributions show some general trends: a greater diversity of the production systems coexisting within the same region (especially in Southwestern France) at the end of the Middle Paleolithic; an increased use of the systems characterized by a low degree of blank predetermination (Quina and discoidal systems, Levallois recurrent centripetal method), and the emergence of a flexible, multifunctional toolkit with a high curation potential. These changes can be attributed to groups with different technical traditions who kept their own fundamental technical identity but who also adopted similar mobility patterns during the unstable climatic period at the end of the Middle Paleolithic, resulting in shared forms of socioeconomic behavior (frequent population moves and increased residential mobility).},

Corominas, présente une stratigraphie moustérienne de plus de 3 mètres (couches 30 à 44), comprise entre le début du stade isotopique 5 et le stade 3. Les sept ensembles stratigraphiques moustériens (G à A) se sont déposés durant des phases fortement humides et humides/fraîches (G à F), froides à extrêmement froides (E à C), puis plus tempéreés-fraîches (B à A). Les différents ensembles industriels de l’Arbreda peuvent être rattachés typologiquement au grand complexe du Moustérien typique méditerranéen de la frange orientale des Pyrénées, bien que fortement marqués par des influences charentiennes. L’abondance des collections (près de 14 000 pièces) et la variabilité des types de matières premières (porphyres, cornéennes, grès, calcaires, lydiennes et plusieurs types de quartz, quartzites et silex), toutes en quantités importantes, permettent différentes approches technologiques. Les patrimoines techniques hérités, les capacités d’adaptabilité et de compréhension des roches ainsi que leur mise en oeuvre, sont recherchés par la variabilité des méthodes et des techniques de production pour chaque type de roche à partir d’une approche diachronique. Selon une approche chronologique et toutes matières premières confondues sont décelées les évolutions générales des techniques et des modalités de production ainsi que leurs différentes associations intégrées par ces groupes moustériens sur une période de 80 000 ans. D’autant plus qu’une assez forte cohésion typologique se dessine tout au long de la stratigraphie. Cette continuité peut laisser entrevoir une certaine stabilité des groupes moustériens dans le sens de l’héritage et du patrimoine culturels. Ces études sont favorisées aussi par la continuité des grandes lignes technologiques de débitage qui s’articulent autour des méthodes discoïdes et Levallois. De ce fait, il est possible d’appréhender les évolutions et les associations technologiques importantes au travers de leurs différentes modalités.},

Its adoption in an altogether diﬀerent role in bio-assay has been determined decisively by the individual actions and personal histories of a few scholars: the widespread acceptance of the growth function is due to Pearl and Reed, the general recognition of Verhulst’s primacy to Yule, and the introduction of the function in bio-assay to Berkson.},

This industry is estimated to be contemporary with wurmian period. Rock provisioning was carried out within a 33 km radius, although local flint is omnipresent. The Levallois débitage is recurrent then lineal, with mainly centripetal preparation and recurrence, then bipolar and both parallel and convergent unipolar. Other débitage techniques are associated with the Levallois; débitage on flakes, discoidal, Quina, orthogonal, unipolar or anvil débitage. Sidescrapers (48 \%) are almost always simple with flat retouch and dominate the notched tools (17 \%), which are essentially composed of notches. Backed knives (7 \%) make up half of the group IV tools. All of the bifaces (6 \%) tend to be cordiform and are of similar manufacture. Lastly, the relative abundance of choppers (16 \%), is another strong characteristic of this industry. This industry is the only real representative of this facies in the western Mediterranean and is part of the MTA of the south of France. The typological singularities liken it to the MTA of the middle Tarn basin, while its technological characteristics are close to the MTA situated further to the west.},

The Levallois core reduction technique largely prevails demonstrating diversiﬁed modes of exploitation (mainly recurrent centripetal or unidirectional knapping, sometimes the preferential ﬂake technique at the end of the core exploitation). Levallois end-products, knapped in situ on local raw materials, were frequently exported, while cores already exploited seem to have been introduced into the site. The retouched tool kit is dominated by sidescrapers, but the blanks as well as their modiﬁcation by retouching do not seem to be linked with the Quina Charentian facies: on the contrary, all the blanks are the result of the Levallois technology and the classical Quina retouch is quite rare. In this case, clearly the idea of a speciﬁc facies called «Atypical Charentian» must be abandoned.},

The pseudo-residuals are the gradient of the loss functional being minimized, with respect to the model values at each training data point evaluated at the current step. It is shown that both the approximation accuracy and execution speed of gradient boosting can be substantially improved by incorporating randomization into the procedure. Speciÿcally, at each iteration a subsample of the training data is drawn at random (without replacement) from the full training data set. This randomly selected subsample is then used in place of the full sample to ÿt the base learner and compute the model update for the current iteration. This randomized approach also increases robustness against overcapacity of the base learner. c 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

              Levallois technology is the name for the stone knapping technique used to create tools thousands of years ago. The technique appeared in the archeological record across Eurasia 200 to 300 thousand years ago (ka) and appeared earlier in Africa. Adler
              et al.
              challenge the hypothesis that the technique's appearance in Eurasia was the result of the expansion of hominins from Africa. Levallois obsidian artifacts in the southern Caucasus, dated at 335 to 325 ka, are the oldest in Eurasia. This suggests that Levallois technology may have evolved independently in different hominin populations. Stone technology cannot thus be used as a reliable indicator of Paleolithic human population change and expansion.

              The Lower to Middle Paleolithic transition ({\textasciitilde}400,000 to 200,000 years ago) is marked by technical, behavioral, and anatomical changes among hominin populations throughout Africa and Eurasia. The replacement of bifacial stone tools, such as handaxes, by tools made on flakes detached from Levallois cores documents the most important conceptual shift in stone tool production strategies since the advent of bifacial technology more than one million years earlier and has been argued to result from the expansion of archaic
              Homo sapiens
              out of Africa. Our data from Nor Geghi 1, Armenia, record the earliest synchronic use of bifacial and Levallois technology outside Africa and are consistent with the hypothesis that this transition occurred independently within geographically dispersed, technologically precocious hominin populations with a shared technological ancestry.},

              Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5, {\textasciitilde} 130 to 71 thousand years ago, was a key period for the geographic expansion of
              Homo sapiens
              , including engagement with new landscapes within Africa and dispersal into Asia. Occupation of the Levant by
              Homo sapiens
              in MIS 5 is well established, while recent research has documented complementary evidence in Arabia. Here, we undertake the first detailed comparison of Levallois core technology from eastern Africa, Arabia, and the Levant during MIS 5, including multiple sites associated with
              Homo sapiens
              fossils. We employ quantitative comparisons of individual artefacts that provides a detailed appraisal of Levallois reduction activity in MIS 5, thereby enabling assessment of intra- and inter-assemblage variability for the first time. Our results demonstrate a pattern of geographically structured variability embedded within a shared focus on centripetal Levallois reduction schemes and overlapping core morphologies. We reveal directional changes in core shaping and flake production from eastern Africa to Arabia and the Levant that are independent of differences in geographic or environmental parameters. These results are consistent with a common cultural inheritance between these regions, potentially stemming from a shared late Middle Pleistocene source in eastern Africa.},

Nowhere has this topic provoked more interest and debate than in the Middle Palaeolithic of southwestern France. The region's rich archaeological record has produced numerous sites, many of which have been recently excavated and thus provide a reliable dataset for better structuring Mousterian lithic variability. Researchers working with these types of datasets frequently employ the chaîne op eratoire concept to approach lithic assemblage variability; however, the validity of such analyses has recently been questioned. Here we present results of a combined quantitative and qualitative technological analysis of a large sample of assemblages from numerous well-contextualised sites in the northeastern Aquitaine Basin. We selected clearly identifiable diagnostic elements typical of different flake production systems that can be quantified by different analysts in a replicable fashion. Our results show strong differences in assemblage composition in terms of dominant production systems as well as a smaller number of mixed assemblages that combine two or more flake production methods. When considered together, these results provide not only a means for defining lithic technocomplexes and subsequently comparing assemblages but also for investigating elements of Neanderthal material culture variability.},

Their peculiarities are due to their roles as both a technological objective and in the management of core convexities to retain its geometric properties during reduction. In Middle Paleolithic con­ texts, these backed implements are commonly produced during Levallois and discoidal reduction sequences. Backed products from Levallois and discoidal reduction sequences often show common geometric and morphological features that complicate their attribution to one of these methods. This study examines the identification of experimentally produced discoidal and recurrent centripetal Levallois backed products (including all stages of reduction) based on their morphological features. 3D geometric morphometrics are employed to quantify morphological variability among the experimental sample. Dimensionality reduction though principal component analysis is combined with 11 machine learning models for the identification of knapping methods. A supported vector machine with polynomial kernel has been identified as the best model (with a general accuracy of 0.76 and an area under the curve [AUC] of 0.8). This indicates that combining geometric morphometrics, principal component analysis, and machine learning models succeeds in capturing the morphological differences of backed products according to the knapping method.},

	volume = {10},
	abstract = {Lithic artefacts are usually associated with the different knapping methods used in their production. Flakes exhibit metric and technological features representative of the flaking method used to detach them. However, lithic production is a dynamic process in which discrete methods can be blurred, and in which features can vary throughout the process. An intermediate knapping method between the discoid and Levallois is commonly referred to under an umbrella of terms (the present research uses the term hierarchical discoid), and is associated with a broad geographical and chronological distribution throughout the Early and Middle Palaeolithic. This intermediate knapping strategy exhibits features of both the discoid and Levallois knapping methods, raising the question of the extent to which flakes from the three knapping methods can be differentiated and, when one is mistaken for another, the direction of confusion. An experimental assemblage of flakes detached by means of the three methods was used along with an attribute analysis and machine learning models in an effort to identify the knapping methods employed. In general, our results were able to very effectively differentiate between the three knapping methods when a support vector machine with polynomial kernel was used. Our results also underscored the singularity of flakes detached by means of Levallois reduction sequences, which yielded outstanding identification values, and were rarely erroneously attributed to either of the other two knapping methods studied. Mistaking the products of the discoid and hierarchical discoid methods was the most common direction of confusion, although a good identification value was achieved for discoid flakes and an acceptable value for hierarchical discoid flakes. This shows the potential applicability of machine learning models in combination with attribute analysis for the identification of these knapping methods among flakes.},

This type of use of 2D data is still widespread today and will likely remain common for several years due to its simplicity, eﬃciency and low cost. However, using 2D pictures to measure morphological variation in a 3D object is an approximation that inevitably implies measurement error. Despite this being an obvious problem, which was emphasized since the early days of the ﬁrst applications of geometric morphometrics to biology, whether 2D is a good proxy for 3D has been a rather neglected topic in the literature until very recently. In this paper, using marmot mandibles and crania as an example, I show how to assess the potentially crucial impact of ’missing the third dimension’ in 2D landmarks and suggest a new method to test the accuracy of these data: the method is simple and can be easily performed in a user-friendly free software such as MorphoJ. This test is complimentary to other more exploratory analyses, that can also be performed using free programs and might oﬀer a routine protocol to estimate the goodness of the 2D to 3D approximation in geometric morphometrics. Example data and a fully worked out MorphoJ project are provided for readers to learn how to replicate the analysis.},

With the growing use of geometric morphometrics in archaeology, it is important to understand and identify limitations in the method. One such limitation is the accumulation of measurement error. Here, we investigate the impact of parallax or the effect of the position of an object in relation to the camera. We designed an experiment to assess the effect of parallax on measurements of artifact morphology by photographing a sample of artifacts at close range (50 cm) and systematically shifting the fixed angle of the camera relative to the artifact in five steps: 90°, 95°, 100°, 105°, and 110°. We took digital images of geometric microliths from three Jordanian Epipalaeolithic sites at each of the camera angles. We then digitized the outline of each artifact using 24 sliding landmarks. Our subsequent analyses of microlith shapes grouped by camera angle show that they are statistically indistinguishable from each other, which suggests that within these parameters, parallax has little effect on geometric morphometric measurements. While taking digital images directly above artifacts is ideal, the angle at which previously published photographs of artifacts is sometimes unknown. Our findings suggest that small deviations of the camera angle (up to 20° from horizontal) will not significantly impact geometric morphometric analyses.},

The 2D and 3D shape variables capture common patterns across taxa, such that the pairwise Procrustes distances among taxa correspond and the trends captured by principal component analysis are similar in the xy plane. We use the two sets of landmarks to test several ecomorphological hypotheses from the literature. Both 2D and 3D data reject the hypothesis that head shape correlates significantly with the depth at which a species is commonly found. However, in taxa where shape variation in the z-axis is high, the 2D shape variables show sufficiently strong distortion to influence the outcome of the hypothesis tests regarding the relationship between mouth size and feeding ecology. Only the 3D data support previous studies which showed that large mouth sizes correlate positively with high percentages of elusive prey in the diet. When used to test for morphological divergence, 3D data show no evidence of divergence, while 2D data show that one clade of oligocottines has diverged from all others. This clade shows the greatest degree of z-axis body depth within Oligocottinae, and we conclude that the inability of the 2D approach to capture this lateral body depth causes the incongruence between 2D and 3D analyses.

	abstract = {Large tanged points are known from several Final Palaeolithic technocomplexes in Europe. In different regions, they are known by different labels (e.g. Bromme points, Lyngby points, and Teyjat points) and are often given culturally and hence chronologically diagnostic status as important fossiles directeurs, especially in northern Europe. The vast majority of these ﬁnds are from the surface or derive from less-than-secure contexts. Several recent papers have cast doubt on the validity of this artefact class as a taxonomically sensitive marker. Here, we further investigate this issue using 2D geometric morphometric techniques on a sample of published large tanged points from several key sites in northern Europe. This analysis reveals a substantial amount of shape variation within this artefact class and ﬁnds no support for distinctions between large tanged points derived from different cultural and/or chronological contexts. Our analysis thus strongly supports the notion that large tanged points do not function as useful culturally diagnostic marker artefacts. The earliest occurrences of Final Palaeolithic large tanged points date to late GS-2 or GI-1e ({\textasciitilde}15,000–14,000 cal BP), alongside arch-backed points. Their presence in later assemblages and technocomplexes such as the Brommean cannot therefore be considered as a derived or diagnostic feature. We suggest that this artefact class should rather be linked to weapon systems function (dart-points) different from the coeval arch-backed points (arrowheads) and that deﬁnitions of cultures based on these should thus be taken up for critical revision.},

Both the log shape ratio (LSR) based on linear measurements and elliptical Fourier analysis (EFA) based on 2D outlines are used to analyse a sample of 2372 stone artefacts from Song Terus cave (Java, Indonesia). The results show that no speciﬁc form corresponds to a speciﬁc function or vice versa. Nevertheless, among used artefacts, EFA highlighted several shape tendencies.},

Here we report a study in which geometric morphometrics and multivariate statistics were used to compare the shapes of the blades of Clovis, Folsom and Plainview points from the Southern Plains of North America. In the course of the analyses, we controlled for the impact of three potential confounding factors: allometry, differences in raw material quality, and resharpening. The analyses show that blade shape distinguishes Clovis points from both Folsom points and Plainview points, but does not distinguish Folsom points from Plainview points. The analyses also show that the similarities and differences in blade shape among the types are independent of allometry, raw material quality, and resharpening. These ﬁndings suggest that the type deﬁnitions for Clovis, Folsom and Plainview need to be altered. They also have implications for typing specimens that lack other deﬁning characters (e.g. channel ﬂakes, ﬂutes). Lastly, the absence of resharpening effects raises questions about the validity of the reduction thesis.},

	abstract = {Quantitative analyses of morphological variation using geometric morphometrics are often performed on 2D photos of 3D structures. It is generally assumed that the error due to the ﬂattening of the third dimension is negligible. However, despite hundreds of 2D studies, few have actually tested this assumption and none has done it on large animals, such as those typically classiﬁed as megafauna. We explore this issue in living equids, focusing on ventral cranial variation at both micro- and macro-evolutionary levels. By comparing 2D and 3D data, we found that size is well approximated, whereas shape is more strongly impacted by 2D inaccuracies, as it is especially evident in intra-speciﬁc analyses. The 2D approximation improves when shape diﬀerences are larger, as in macroevolution, but even at this level precise inter-individual similarity relationships are altered. Despite this, main patterns of sex, species and allometric variation in 2D were the same as in 3D, thus suggesting that 2D may be a source of ‘noise’ that does not mask the main signal in the data. However, the picture that emerges from this and other recent studies on 2D approximation of 3D structures is complex and any generalization premature. Morphometricians should therefore test the appropriateness of 2D using preliminary investigations in relation to the speciﬁc study questions in their own samples. We discuss whether this might be feasible using a reduced landmark conﬁguration and smaller samples, which would save time and money. In an exploratory analysis, we found that in equids results seem robust to sampling, but become less precise and, with fewer landmarks, may slightly overestimate 2D inaccuracies.},
